        $"They built shrines and temples to honor their primitive deities, and originally were a positive force in the region, helping nearby villages with their knowledge, magic, and miracles. " +
        $"Their warriors were protecting the land from local monsters, and they even pushed back the kobold hordes for decades, all on their own.",
        // page 2
        "> Over time, their beliefs shifted, and their cult took a darker turn. Outdoor shrines went vacant as more and more underground rooms were dug, scaring the earth they once honored. " +
        "The memory of their own ancestors became more important than the balance of nature. The __Freinort artefacts__ were twisted. Soon, they were able to harness the power of the dead. " +
        "And as they were becoming even more powerful, the region gradually fell into chaos. " +
        "It all peaked when they started filling their __ossuary__ with the bones of massacred inhabitants from the nearby villages, planning on using them to raise an army of the dead.",
        // page 3
        "> That's when the glorious northern __Holy Church__ intervened. They fought against their undead minions and slayed their unholy cultists. " +
        "Their underground rooms were buried, their altars shattered, and their faith was no more. " +
        "To restore balance in the region, and save the remaining humans from chaos, they erected a large fortress or the fuming rubbles of __Freinort__. " +
        "This fortress expanded over time, and became the great city-state of Sineah, keeping peace in this part of the world, and holding the front against the ever-growing kobold hordes."

> However, if you can't afford to wait for a priest, here's a few points to help you stay alive:
> - Undead are very vulnerable to fire. Most will burn to a crisp within a minute once set ablaze.
> - Undead cannot get sick, poisoned, weakened, taunted, frenzied, nor stunned.
> - If you are able to use any kind of healing magic, using it on undead will actually hurt them.
> - Undead are slow, and are unlikely to chase after you if you flee.
> There are multiple types of undead creatures, listed below from less dangerous to most dangerous:
> - Skeleton: very fragile, but still dangerous. Be cautious if you choose to fight.
> - Zombi: quite a resistant foe, try to avoir them.
> - Ghost: those ethereal fiends are immune to physical attacks.
> - Ghoul: stronger version of the zombi. Extremely aggressive and quite fast for an undead.
> - Banshee: ethereal undead, immune to physical attacks. Their cry can instantly kill a lesser soul.
> - Lich: rare and powerful undead. They are rumored to be immortal, and wield terrifying magic.
> None of the aformentioned undead creature can be defeated by a non-veteran adventurer.
